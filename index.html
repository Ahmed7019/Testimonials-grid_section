                    <p><q>Before joining the bootcamp,I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
                            professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.I was encouraged to enroll by a
                            former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
                            curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
                            They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project,
                            in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way the no
                            tutorial could ever have. In fact,I've often referred to it during interviews as an example
                            of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer
                            after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!</q></p>
